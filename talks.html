            <p>In the cloud world, the attack surface for an application is
            much larger than in an on-premise deployment.  Current commonly
            used languages provide limited support for security, with
            vulnerabilities such as Injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection,
            cross-site scripting, etc), and Leaks of sensitive data being the
            most representative vulnerabilities exploited in web applications
            over the past 5 years.  Combined with the trend towards micro
            services, where services are language agnostic and hence are
            implemented by various languages at a time, we have a growing
            security problem that needs to be addressed now.</p>

            <p>In this talk I give an overview of the problem, I’ll review some
            solutions that have practical applications, and we’ll embark on the
            first steps to develop a new language that addresses the lack of
            security concepts provided in today’s commonly used languages for
            web and cloud applications.</p>

            <p>A programming language is a user interface to an abstract
            machine. Designing a new programming language for an existing
            abstract machine is an important and useful task (e.g. Scala on the
            JVM, F# on the CLR, etc.), but sometimes we want to design a new
            abstract machine, perhaps to cope with custom hardware, to provide
            a new approach to concurrency, or to provide new runtime guarantees
            to the source language. Let's talk about writing a small-step
            operational semantics and designing a runtime, using Pony (and a
            hypothetical extension to the Pony abstract machine) as an example.</p>

            <p>We will study the kinds of problems that system configuration

            their strengths and weaknesses, and walk through the design and
            implementation of verification and program-repair tools for

            distill a large, real-world configuration language into a simpler
            language that is amenable for analysis; we will discuss tradeoffs
            between accuracy and complexity in analysis design; and we will

            <p>Many compiler textbooks and courses treat compilation as a
            "batch process", where the compiler takes in a bunch of input
            files, executes a suite of comiler passes, and ultimately produces
            object code as output. Increasingly, though, users expect
            integration with IDEs like VSCode, which requires a different
            structure. Moreover, many languages have recursive constructs where
            the correct processing order is difficult to determine statically.
            Nicholas will discuss some of the work the Rust team has been doing
            on restructuring the compiler to support incremental compilation
            and IDE integration.</p>

            <p>Static program analysis is the art of reasoning about the
            behavior of computer programs without actually running them. This
            is useful not only in optimizing compilers for producing efficient
            code but also for automatic error detection and other tools that
            can help programmers.</p>

            <p>This lecture will present essential principles and algorithms for
            static program analysis, based on material from <a
            href="http://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/spa/">http://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/spa/</a>.
            We take a constraint-based approach where suitable constraint
            systems conceptually divide analysis into a front-end that
            generates constraints from program code and a back-end that solves
            the constraints to produce the analysis results. If time permits,
            the lecture will be accompanied by theoretical exercises and by
            practical exercises based on a Scala implementation of the
            algorithms.</p>

            <p>The approach to language and compiler design taken by industry
            can differ greatly from the state of the art documented in academic
            literature (or even open source). Runtime performance and
            reusability often take a back seat to scalability, affinity for
            tooling, and even product marketing. This difference in priorities
            can result in design or implementation decisions that feel
            counter-intuitive to the uninitiated, but are necessary for staying
            ahead of the steep adoption curves we often experience. After years
            of indoctrinating new hires in this different and scantly
            documented point of view, I'd like to open up a bit and maybe even
            open up some new lines of inquiry.</p>

            <p>In this lecture I'll be enumerating the differences between the
            "theory" and "practice" of language development as I've experienced
            them in my years in industry. In doing so I'll be taking you on a
            tour of the entire stack - from VMs and back-end code generators,
            to type checkers, parsers, standard libraries, and IDEs -
            explaining how approaches may differ from what you'd expect, and
            how seemingly minor language design decisions can result in massive
            opportunity costs. Along the way I'll provide plenty of anecdotes
            about the pleasant surprises and regretable mistakes behind some of
            today's more popular developer tools, and outline where I think
            things are going in the decade to come.</p>

            <p>DRAM’s dominance may be coming to an end, and sooner than you
            think.  New memory technologies promise increased density,
            decreased cost and most importantly, an end to volatility, since
            they do not need power to maintain state. The consequences for the
            way we program — and on the design of programming languages — will
            be profound.  In this presentation I’ll describe the opportunities
            and challenges that arise from Non-Volatile RAM, and the plethora
            of PhD-worthy problems that will need to be solved.</p>
