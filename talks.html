            Machines </a> <a class="pn-aff-name"> Steve Blackburn </a>
            <p>Many of today’s programming languages are broken. Poor
            performance, lack of features and hard-to-reason-about semantics
            can cost dearly in software maintenance and inefficient
            execution.  An important reason for this brokenness is that much
            of language design is implementation-driven. The difficulties in
            implementation and insufficient understanding of concepts bake
            bad designs into the language itself. Concurrency, architectural
            details and garbage collection are three fundamental concerns
            that contribute much to the complexities of implementing managed
            languages.  In this lecture I will describe the micro virtual
            machine, a thin abstraction designed specifically to relieve
            implementers of managed languages of the most fundamental
            implementation challenges that currently impede good design. The
            micro virtual machine targets abstractions over memory (garbage
            collection), architecture (compiler backend), and concurrency. I
            will motivate the micro virtual machine and give an account of
            the design and initial experience of a concrete instance, which
            we call Mu, built over a four year period. Our goal is to remove
            an important barrier to performant and semantically sound
            managed language design and implementation.</p>

	    <p>Writing JIT compilers for dynamic languages by hand is an
	    arduous and heroic process, particularly for dynamic languages
	    with “interesting” semantics. Meta-tracing is an approach for
	    reducing that effort; VM authors only write an interpreter and
	    some hints. In this hands-on session students will implement a
	    small dynamic language from scratch as well as a JITusing the
	    RPython meta-tracing language that underlies the PyPy project.

            <p>Whenever the need to compile a new dynamically typed language
            arises, an appealing option is to repurpose an existing
            statically typed language Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler. This
            lecture will examine the benefits and limitations of the
            repurposed JIT approach. How far can JITs be stretched? </p>

            <p>Building any kind of high performance garbage collector for a
            complete language implementation is hard. High performance
            requires careful attention to detail and bugs are notoriously
            difficult to discover. Add to the mix, copying and full
            concurrency (on-the-fly collection) makes the task even
            harder. In this talk, I'll explain how we built a high
            performance, replication copying, fully concurrent collector for
            Java, focusing in particular on how we obtained confidence that
            the collector was correct.</p>

    <p>This talk will focus on methods for testing compilers to find defects
            early -- which are readily applicable to rapidly evolving
            compiler code bases, such as the gcc and LLVM open source
            compiler projects.  I'll cover the major techniques that have
            been investigated in recent research literature: differential
            testing, equivalence modulo inputs testing, and program
            enumeration, explaining what these are, what their associated
            benefits and drawbacks are, and how they complement each other.
            I will finish by giving an overview of an ongoing

            <p> Julia is a multimethod-based language with an unusually
            powerful dispatch system that has been useful for organizing
            large numerical libraries. Although Julia is dynamically typed,
            it is also designed to support static analysis and generation of
            efficient code. In the first part of this talk, I'll discuss our
            design considerations and the techniques needed to make the
            design work in practice. In the second part, I'll cover
            lower-level implementation issues, including our experience with
            LLVM, and general gotchas encountered when interfacing with
            real-world systems software. </p>

            <p>It's no secret that Scala is a powerful language; whether you want to
            use it as a host language to embed your own DSLs in or you want to
            lift as much of your computation to the type level as possible. What
            many people don't know, however, is that some of these language
            features can be combined to allow you to make modest extensions to the
            compiler as libraries. In this talk, I'll walk you through some of
            Scala's more advanced features that can enable you to build your own
            modest compiler extensions, mostly as libraries! </p>

            <p>Encore is a new, open source, experimental object-oriented
            programming language developed in the UPSCALE EU
            project. Encore's starting point is the actor model with its
            inherent support for concurrent programming. Encore goes beyond
            the actor model, adding futures and active object-style
            asynchronous structured programming.  This lecture will focus on
            how Encore extends the actor model with so-called hot objects,
            and how that integration hits all parts of language design:
            surface syntax, type system, scheduling and garbage
            collection.</p>

            <p>Pony is a new, actor-based,  strongly typed  programming language
            designed to make it easy to write efficient, safe concurrent programs.
            We will discuss the rationale for the development of Pony, give a
            short introduction to the actor paradigm, introduce  the type system,
            and show how it supports the development of datarace-free programs 
            which allow actors to share mutable state, and message passing without 
            copying. We will develop some small demonstrator examples. We will 
            also discuss causality: what it is a and what it buys for the programmer.
            We will outline salient parts of Pony’s implementation: the runtime
            organization, message queues, the scheduler, and garbage collection,
            and will show how the type system and causality were  employed to allow
            these the be efficiently implemented. </p>

            Weak Consistency and Isolation </a> <a class="pn-aff-name">
            Suresh Jagannathan </a>
            <p>Web services replicate application state and logic across
            multiple replicas within and across data centers. Replication is
            intended not only to improve application throughput and reduce
            user-perceived latency, but also to tolerate partial failures.
            Strong consistency models such as serializability, while easy to
            understand and specify, mask the realities underlying
            large-scale distributed systems with respect to non-uniform
            latency, availability, and network partitions.  Web services,
            which aim to provide an "always-on" experience, overwhelmingly
            favor availability and partition tolerance over strong
            consistency. To this end, several weak consistency models such
            as eventual consistency have been deployed.  Weakly consistent
            systems complicate program reasoning by allowing concurrent
            conflicting updates and by exposing inconsistencies that may
            violate high-level program invariants.  We will study the
            semantics of such systems, and explore abstractions and
            formalisms that can be brought to bear to tame their complexity.
